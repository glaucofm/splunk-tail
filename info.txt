Base project:
    https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start-typescript

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

    package.json - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
    main.ts - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main process.
    index.html - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.

To Use:

    npm install
    npm start

To recompile automatically and to allow using electron-reload, run this in a separate terminal:

    npm run watch
